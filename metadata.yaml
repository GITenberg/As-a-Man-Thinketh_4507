description: "As a Man Thinketh is a literary essay and book by James Allen, published\
  \ in 1903. It was described by Allen as \"... [dealing] with the power of thought,\
  \ and particularly with the use and application of thought to happy and beautiful\
  \ issues. I have tried to make the book simple, so that all can easily grasp and\
  \ follow its teaching, and put into practice the methods which it advises. It shows\
  \ how, in his own thoughtâ€”world, each man holds the key to every condition, good\
  \ or bad, that enters into his life, and that, by working patiently and intelligently\
  \ upon his thoughts, he may remake his life, and transform his circumstances. The\
  \ price of the book is only one shilling, and it can be carried in the pocket.\"\
  \  It was also described by Allen as \"A book that will help you to help yourself\"\
  , \"A pocket companion for thoughtful people\", and \"A book on the power and right\
  \ application of thought.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
